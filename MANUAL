files and builds PDFs from those. It starts as many threads as CPU cores
are available.

=== Commands ===

		testcases folder and stores images of all pages in
		the dapscompare-reference folders.
				
compare		Builds all DC files contained in sub folders of the
		testcases folder and subtracts them from the reference
		images.
		
=== Parameters ===
		
--daps=''	Allows to pass any parameters to daps. The base command
		is "daps -d DC-file pdf"

--visual	dapscompare is going to start a GUI after all comparison
		images are build and highlight all changes for the user.
